## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. :octocat:

## GitHub issues

In most cases please open a [github issue][github-issue] within the related repository.

## Code related contributions

How do I make a code related contribution?
Never made an open-source contribution before? Wondering how contributions work in our project? Here's a quick rundown!

Find an issue that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you would like to add.

Please first make sure a GitHub issue related to the change you want to do is existing within the related repository.

- [fork this repository][github-fork]
- Do your work within the forked repository
- [Open a pull request][github-pr] from your forked repository to the target repository
- Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.
- Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them.
- Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged! :tada:
